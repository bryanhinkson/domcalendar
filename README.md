#Dom Calendar

This is a pure javascript calendar.

I made this because I wasn't able to find something like this that was pre-built.

I found plenty things that were overly complicated or in languages like typescript which needs to be compiled to javascript.


#setup
Just copy and paste the code to where you want it to be.  The only restriction is that you need to keep the id's and class names
the same so that the css and javascript variables all line up correctly.  (Feel free to update them as you see fit)

##Notes
This is not a fully functional calendar where you can add events etc.  It is just the frontend for it and is meant to be
extended.  

Add Event listeners to whatever you want to provide additional functionality.
